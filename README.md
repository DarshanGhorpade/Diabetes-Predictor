â€¢ This repository consists of files required to deploy a ___Web App___ created with ___Flask___ on ___Microsoft___ Azure.# diabetes_predictor
The project helps the user to identify whether someone is suffering from diabetes by simply inputting certain values like BMI, Glucose level, Blood pressure etc. with the help of a Kaggle database.

By using the statistical data about how certain aspects like BMI, Glucose level, Insulin level, age etc. impact if an individual is prone to diabetes or not, the project will be able to tell the user if the person has diabetes or not by entering those values. So in a way the project will help in monitoring the likelihood of someone developing diabetes. The project can be extended to include other diseases prediction which I will incorporate later down the road.
